# COVID-19 Impact Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 across different countries using real-world datasets. The analysis focuses on case trends, mortality rates, government responses, and economic impact. The study is performed using Python in Google Colab for data processing and transformation.
📊 Dataset Details
1️⃣ Raw Data (raw_data.csv)
Contains the original COVID-19 dataset with unprocessed information.
Data includes country-level statistics, economic indicators, and government response measures.
2️⃣ Transformed Data (transformed_data.csv)
The cleaned and structured dataset used for analysis.
Columns included:
Country Code → ISO country code
Country → Name of the country
Date → Date of recorded data
Total Cases → Cumulative COVID-19 cases
Total Deaths → Cumulative deaths due to COVID-19
Stringency Index → Government response severity (0 to 100%)
Human Development Index (HDI) → Country development level
GDP Per Capita → Economic strength per person
Population → Total population of the country
3️⃣ Google Colab Notebook (Covid_19_Impacts_Analysis.ipynb)
Data Cleaning → Handles missing values and renames columns for clarity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Identifies trends, patterns, and distributions.
Statistical Insights → Calculates mortality rates and response severity.
Visualizations → Uses matplotlib and seaborn for graphical insights.
🔧 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Google Colab
CSV Data Processing
